<p>This portfolio will be an attempt to show how easy it is to fake an online persona. I have represented others' work as my own, and encourage the reader to try and distinguish between what is mine and what belongs to someone else. If you do some research, it should be easy. But most people don't research the posts they see on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, etc. The endless scrolling featured on a lot of modern sites encourages thoughtless consumption. Why look deeper when something more interesting could just be a swipe away? If you want to see what work is actually mine, you can view my real portfolio here.

<p>I've always had a mixed relationship with social media. In middle school, I got my first phone. I had to share it with my brother and my parents checked the messages at the end of every day. Before I had even discovered myspace, I was already learning to censor myself in technological communication. In high school, I started using iChat and Facebook because all my friends were doing it. The contact with friends was great, and I have many happy memories of sitting at home after school and avoiding my homework by chatting with friends. Unfortunately, like many things in high school, it began to feel like a popularity contest. If I wasn't chatting with my friends every night, I felt like I was missing out. If I didn't have as many friends on Facebook, I felt like I wasn't cool enough. At the same time, using Facebook and iChat felt inauthentic. I didn't act like myself, I acted the way I thought people wanted me to. Instead of responding like most people and curating my profile, I "rejected" social media as an attempt to define myself apart from the herd. Despite my outward self-righteousness, I still lurked online, and inwardly obsessed over my popularity. </p>

<p>Junior year of college, I struggled with isolation and confusion over my sexual identity. I started taking adderall, eventually leading to a long Facebook post in which I came out publicly. I felt like I had no one to turn to, and Facebook was a way to externalize the feelings I couldn't process on my own. I was fortunate to have amazing friends who supported me after it became clear I was suffering, and with their advice I deleted my posts once I realized I didn't want to broadcast my internal struggles online. I have since stopped using most social media, as I personally do not find it fulfilling. <strong> While a powerful tool for many endeavors, Social media is NOT a replacement for human interaction. </strong> I hope to encourage others to be more conscious about their use of online platforms and more critical of the content they view. You only see what people want you to see. Don't mistake your feed for the truth.</p>
