<h1 style = "text-align:center"> Deanonymizing Yikyak Post Location </h1>

<p> My first experience with academic research. I worked with a classmate Carson Nemelka under Dean Keith Ross and his PhD student Minhui Xue to determine the location data of any post made to the social media platform Yik-Yak. Yik-Yak didn't implement any obfuscation, so in the end we were able to pinpoint any post to the building it was made from. Not a very anonymous service at all. You can read the resulting publication <a href = "https://shanghai.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/media/yy_imc_2016.pdf">here</a>. </p>
