<p> I am currently working with Michael Naimark, David Santiano, and Luo Runxin to develop a glasses-free live 3D teleconferencing system. The university is still in talks about whether or not to seek patent protection, so I am unable to disclose more publicly. We are actively looking for talented programmers and designers to help out. If you are interested in applying or want more info, please contact me at clb478@nyu.edu</p>
